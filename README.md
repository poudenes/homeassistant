# HOME ASSISTANT # 

This is my Home Assistant Github. Here i store my whole configuration files in case my system crash...

I have a nice apartment in Amsterdam and love automation. So i started first with Domoticz. 
A great open source platform to learn how to automate my house. Now i'm using Home Assistant. More powerful.

To edit my configuration i use VCS Add-On or when on vacation a tiny small iOS SSH application :D 
Can fetch, pull, push all my changes to Github. on HA Server i pull the new data back.

**My Security:**
Im using Cloudflared to create a tunnel between HA and the bad outside internet world.
Cloudflare will proxied them via the tunnel to HA. 
No Ports are open on my router anymore, and no subdomains are pointing to my IP addrress.
